Project Summary:	This project is a mobile application designed to help community members easily browse events, view details, and register for activities. The app includes features such as a home screen, event listings, event detail pages, user registration, and settings such as dark mode. The goal was to create a simple, user-friendly interface that supports smooth navigation across multiple screens.

What Went Well:	

. Highlights :
– Successfully created a multi-screen mobile app.
– UI layout for events was clean and easy to navigate.
– Dark mode was implemented smoothly.
– Git & GitHub were fully set up.

. what worked Effectively:
 – Navigation between screens worked reliably.
– Event cards displayed correct data without issues.
– All screens loaded without errors or crashes.
– Styling and themes behaved consistently.

Challenges Faced:	
Initial difficulties committing and pushing the project to GitHub due to configuration problems and OneDrive conflicts.

 
 Setting up navigation for different screens required troubleshooting file paths and component imports.
 
Managing styling and dark mode across different screens took extra time to structure properly.

 Some parts of VS Code Git integration were confusing at first, especially authentication with GitHub.

What I'd Improve Next Time:	Improve the UI further with animations or smoother transitions between screens.
 
Add backend integration so events and registration data can be stored online instead of being static.
 
Add form validation and better error messages for the registration screen.
 
Optimise the project folder structure (e.g., separating components, data, and context more clearly).

 Implement offline mode or caching so the app works even without internet.
